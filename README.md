# Cumulative Prospect Theory: A Simulative Demonstration

This repository contains a Python simulation demonstrating the principles of Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) as described by Kahneman and Tversky. CPT is a behavioral model that describes how people make decisions under uncertainty, taking into account the tendency to overreact to potential losses and underreact to potential gains, as well as the distortion of probabilities associated with extreme events.


The file **Research Paper.py** includes a breakdown of the mathematical theory of prospect theory and decision under uncertainty. It also contains an explanation of the simulation and analysis of the simulation's results.
The file **CPTSim.py** is the simulation.
